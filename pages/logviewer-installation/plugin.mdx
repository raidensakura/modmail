# Installing Logviewer

**The only recommended way** to run Logviewer on this fork is by using the plugin. The original [Logviewer](https://github.com/modmail-dev/logviewer)
application is inactive, lacks features and is a hassle to set up.

Simply install and load the plugin by running the command on your bot below (`[p]` is your prefix)

```js
[p]plugin load logviewer
```
