# Updating Modmail

Your update method may differ depending on your hosting method. For example, Modmail automatically disables the internal
auto-update function as Docker handles the application differently and does not save application changes.

Other than Docker, your Modmail is set to auto-update itself periodically by default, but you can also run the `[p]update` command on your bot manually, replacing `[p]` with your bot prefix.

#### Updating Modmail on a fork

If your running Modmail is based on a fork of this project, you need to first pull in the changes from this project into your repository in order to update the codebase.
On GitHub, this can be done with the "Sync fork" button on your repository.
