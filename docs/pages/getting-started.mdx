# Getting Started

Modmail is a self-hosted bot. This unfortunately means that there's no public bot invite. 
Furthermore, due to the inner workings of the bot and its highly customisable interfaces, you will need to host your own dedicated Modmail bot.

This section provides setup instructions for Modmail on many hosting methods, both with free and paid options. 
Keep in mind, some free options will still require a payment method for verification.

## Basic requirements

- **A Discord account**  
You will need to create a Discord bot under your account.
- **A MongoDB database instance**  
Modmail will store its internal data to this database.
- **A hosting server**  
To keep Modmail running 24/7 in your server.  
- **Note Editing Program (Notepad for desktop, VSCode, etc.)**  
Anywhere you can copy and paste to temporary store some texts while we set up the bot.
 
<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	There are two components for Modmail: the bot component and the Logviewer component. You will need both to take full advantage of Modmail.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create a Discord bot

The first step in setting up Modmail is to create a Discord bot.
Head over to the Discord Developer Portal and create a new application.

Once you've created a new application, head over to the Bot tab and create a new bot.
![](./assets/create-bot.png)
<sub>Navigate to the Bot tab on the sidebar. On this page, you can also edit the About Me section of your bot.</sub>

Click Add bot to create the bot. After adding a bot, reset the token and copy and store the newly generated token in your Text editor for later use.
![](./assets/reset-token.png)
<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
	Make sure to keep this token private! Anyone who has this token can control your bot and potentially cause malicious damage.
</Callout>

Next, we need to change some bot settings. Toggle off public bot, then toggle on both server members intent and message content intent.
Remember to click on Save Changes.
![](./assets/reset-token.png)
<details>
<summary>Why do I need to do this?</summary>
Disabling _public bot_ prevents other users from inviting your bot. Your bot may not behave appropriately if it's present in other servers.

Enabling _server members intent_ allows Modmail to view your server's members list and efficiently populate the bot's internal cache.

Enabling _message content intent_ allows bot commands to function since Modmail doesn't use slash commands.

What about _presence intent_? It is not needed for Modmail, but it may be required for specialized plugins.
We recommend keeping this toggled off to save computational resources.
</details>

### Invite the bot

Navigate back to the General Information tab and copy the application ID.
Click Copy to copy the application ID. This is also known as your "Bot ID".
![](./assets/bot-id.png)

Using the following URL as template, replace `YOUR-ID-HERE` with the ID you just copied. Do not change anything else! Open a new browser tab and go to that URL.
```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&permissions=416075476184&client_id=YOUR-ID-HERE
```

Discord should prompt you to choose a server to invite your bot, followed by a list of permissions. Scroll to the bottom and click Authorize.
Choose your server to invite, then click Continue.
![](./assets/invite-bot.png)

Scroll to the bottom and click Authorize. Don't un-check any permissions. Only Administrator is optional.
<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	You must leave on all permissions excepted for Administrator (optional).
	However, we recommend allowing Administrator for ease of setup and to avoid complications with Discord permissions.
</Callout>

<details>
<summary>Do you have a separate staff server?</summary>
If you manage a large server where you have a separate server for communication among your moderation team,
Modmail supports directing threads into the staff server instead of your main (public) server.

You will need to invite your Modmail bot to **both** your main (public) server and your staff server using the same invite link above.
</details>

Your bot should now be **offline** in your server. Congratulations, that's as expected! You have successfully created a Discord bot.
The next step is to [create a MongoDB database](./#create-a-mongodb-database).

### Create a MongoDB database

Modmail uses MongoDB to store its internal configurations and log histories. You must create a MongoDB database in order to use Modmail.

We will be using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas), which provides us with a free 512MB storage share—more than enough for Modmail.

Head over to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) and register for a free account:

Once you've registered and confirmed your email, you will be greeted by the MongoDB welcome introduction,
asking you to "tell us a few things about yourself and your project". You can answer these questions honestly or however you like.

In the next step for "deploy a cloud database", choose the **Shared** option. Choose the region that's closest to where you're hosting your bot.
Make sure the **Cluster Tier** is set to **M0 Sandbox** and the price shows as **FREE**.

![](./assets/mongo-shared.png)
<sub>Choose the free **Shared** option and click **Create**.</sub>

On the following **Security Quickstart** page, do the following:

1.  Authentication method: _Username and Password_
    ```Username: `modmail`
    Password: Click **Autogenerate Secure Password** - don't type your own password!```
	![](./assets/mongo-password.png)
2.  Copy and **save the password** into your text editor, you will need this for later.
    From now on, we will be referring to these credentials as the _database username_ and _database password_.
3. Click **Create User**.
4. Scroll down, we will be connecting from: _My Local Environment_
5.  Set IP address as **`0.0.0.0/0`** and anything for the description.
	![](./assets/mongo-ip.png)
	**You must** set the IP address exactly to this, unless you know what you're doing.
	**Do not** set it to anything else or click add my current IP address. This allows Modmail to connect to your database.
6. Click **Add Entry**.

Next, we will need to generate a MongoDB connection string. Simply click `Connect` on the main dashboard,
choose `Connect your application`, then copy the connection string (the default driver is fine) and paste it into your Notepad.

![](./assets/mongo-connect.png)

If you followed all the steps so far, your Notepad should contain three lines:
the bot token, the database password, and the MongoDB connection string. For example:

```md filename="Notepad"
My bot token: MTA3Djv3IAxNjk1NDgdKD231.G1AoUjD.5z629aKP34JKHn4v1EsdNUwdDO3MvBR9ifVES4
My database password: elAO7wF1r07pNG6u
My MongoDB connection string: mongodb+srv://modmail:<password>@cluster0.example.mongodb.net/
```

Finally, you will need to combine the database password with the MongoDB connection string by **replacing**
the `<password>` (including the `<>`) with the database password.

You also need to **remove** everything after `.mongodb.net` at the end of the MongoDB connection string.

This is what your Notepad should look like at the end of this step:

```md filename="Notepad"
My bot token: MTA3Djv3IAxNjk1NDgdKD231.G1AoUjD.5z629aKP34JKHn4v1EsdNUwdDO3MvBR9ifVES4
My MongoDB connection string: mongodb+srv://modmail:elAO7wF1r07pNG6u@cluster0.example.mongodb.net
```

### Preparing your Environmental Variables

Once you have finished the previous steps, gather and save the variables listed below as they will be needed to run your bot in later steps:

* `TOKEN` - The token to run your Modmail application under your Discord bot account
* `LOG_URL` **- \[Optional]** Logviewer URL that will be used to view threads in your web browser
* `GUILD_ID` - The ID of the main Discord server that your bot will operate in.
* `MODMAIL_GUILD_ID` - **\[Optional]** The ID of the Discord server that your bot will create ticket channels in. This is only needed if you want your ticket channels to be created in a separate server, for an example, Staff Server.
* `OWNERS` - The user ID of the Discord accounts you want to set as owner for the bot. Can consist of multiple users, separated by comma.
* `CONNECTION_URI` - The URI the bot will use to connect to your MongoDB instance.

Your finished variables should look something like this:

```env filename=".env"
TOKEN=OTY3Nzy5MzU5NjAzMzU2NzE4.GtKp_5.JOTYRwGW-LB1He5widCu73vXtmi90KxsqkmoOg
LOG_URL=https://logs.mymodmailbot.com/
GUILD_ID=1079074933008781362
OWNERS=188363246695219201,231595246213922828
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0-abcde.mongodb.net/
```

### Hosting Modmail

Your next step is to choose one of our supported hosting method that's available and preferable to you.
Click on one of the links below to view further instructions for your preferred hosting method.
Each method has their pros and cons, be sure to take them into consideration when choosing your hosting platform to run Modmail.

#### [Railway](railway.md) (free/paid)
A platform as a service (PaaS) that offers a generous free plan, which allows you to host Modmail for free without any downtime. A credit card is required for verification purposes. Their UI is very simple and easy for beginners to quickly deploy and run your Modmail bot on. You can learn more about their Free Tier plan and pricing by clicking [here](https://railway.app/pricing).&#x20;

#### [Northflank](https://northflank.com/) (free/paid)

A PaaS like Railway but with more advanced UI and more features. Does require credit card for verification but has a dedicated free tier that has no hourly limit. Learn more about their free tier and pricing by clicking [here](https://northflank.com/pricing).

#### [Local Hosting](local-hosting-vps/) (free)

If you have an old PC, a Raspberry Pi, or a Linux box that you're able to keep online 24/7, you can also host Modmail with your own machine at home. Since Modmail doesn't require intensive resources to run, you can get by with a system having as low as 1GB of RAM. Setting it up can be quite advanced but you have complete control over your bot instance. Refer to our local hosting guide supporting a few popular OSes by clicking [here](./#local-hosting-free).

#### [Modmail Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kyber) (paid)

We offer paid hosting solution for your Modmail bot. Hosting Modmail with us costs $4-5 USD per month.

We will also fully manage your bot hosting for you, so you don't need to worry about upgrading or setting up your own host server. Refer to our [Patreon Hosting here](https://www.patreon.com/kyber).

#### [Heroku](heroku.md) (paid)

Another popular PaaS that's used to be free. However, their recent pricing adjustments, it now costs $5-7 USD per month to host Modmail.

If you are currently a higher-education student, you may be eligible for the first year free with their [student offer](https://www.heroku.com/github-students). Refer to our Heroku installation guide by clicking [here](heroku.md).

#### [Cloud Server / VPS](local-hosting-vps/) (paid)

Apart from [Patreon hosting](./#modmail-patreon-paid), hosting on a cloud server / VPS is the most reliable hosting method. Rent a virtual server from any reputable hosting provider of your choice for roughly $4-10 USD per month (price varies), and you'll be able to install Modmail onto the server.

This method is a lot more "involved" than other solutions. If you're not comfortable with configuring remote Linux environments, we recommend you to choose a different option. For this method, you will need to refer to our Local hosting installation guide [here](local-hosting-vps/) and choose your desired OS.

</Steps>

### Community Guides
If you're not satisfied with the options listed above, some of our community members have created their
own installation guides for Modmail on various other hosting platforms. Keep in mind that Modmail support staff may
not be able to assist you much with community-made guides. Feel free to check them out by clicking the link below.
