# Introduction

Modmail is a self-hosted Python Discord bot for your server. 
It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.
Users create a ticket by direct-messaging the bot on Discord, and it will create a ticket channel
in your chosen server relaying the messages between you and the server staff seamlessly.

It comes with many advanced features and customizable configurations to help you handle tickets smoothly,
such as custom snippets, command aliases, adding multiple users and so on.

With the built-in Logviewer plugin, you can also view previous tickets created on your browser.
